Open estimation was born out of the need for a tool to assist developers in providing more accurate estimations. The system will host projects that contain various elements including a work breakdown tool to assist in breaking the project down into small bite size tasks visually and easily. Our goal is to simplify the process of estimating a project as much as possible to enable the user to deliver quick and accurate estimations.
